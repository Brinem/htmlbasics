    <h2>Mazda Axela</h2>
    <P>The Mazda3 (known as the Mazda Axela in Japan (first three generations), a combination of "accelerate" and "excellent"[4]) is a compact car manufactured by Mazda. It was first introduced in 2003 as a 2004 model, replacing the Familia/323/Proteg√© in the C-segment.

The second-generation Mazda3 for the 2009 model year was unveiled in late 2008, with the sedan premiering at the Los Angeles Auto Show and the hatchback at the Bologna Motor Show. For the 2012 model year, Mazda began offering the Mazda3 with their newly developed Skyactiv technology, including a more rigid body, a new direct-injection engine, and a new 6-speed transmission.[5]

The third generation was introduced in mid-2013 as a 2014 model year. The third-generation model is the first Mazda3 to adopt the "Kodo" design language and a more complete Skyactiv range of technologies.</P>
